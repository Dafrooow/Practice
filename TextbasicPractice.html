        <P>This is an example of a paragraph in HTML. Notice how it makes the text easier to read.</P>
        <p>I <strong>strongly</strong>recommend using <em>emphasis</em>tags like <strong>strong</strong>and <em>emphasis</em>to highlight important text. Also don't forget details like <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> for details like H<sub>2</sub>0 and E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p></p>Special characters like &amp; , &lt;, &gt;, and &nbsp; are essential to Web development. Remember to use &copy; or &reg; for copyright or registered materials respectively</p>
